The $20 bill in the winter coat, the lost sock to pair with itâ€™s mate, the golf disc that finds its way back into your possession after a winter on the course.'

There is something special about reclaiming something lost. That feeling of completeness is at times subtle, sometimes monumental. The $20 bill in the winter coat, the lost sock to pair with it's mate, the golf disc that finds its way back into your possession after a winter on the course.

More recently for me, was reconnecting with old friends. I'll take a moment here to talk about the type of friendship I have these guys. We don't talk on the phone a lot, don't message on Facebook or see each other every week. Some of them I haven't seen or spoken with in years, but I remember them just as fondly as though they were a constant presence in my life. The type of friendship we have means that time and distance doesn't matter much. We pick back up again as though the conversation has been ongoing the entire time. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8bf8f8bf-9009-440b-a497-d4336d7f5d21.jpg)

We have all changed, grown, pursued our own lives and dreams and endured the hardships of maturing. We have our trials, our struggles with family, work, death and birth. These events help but to strengthen our character, add depth to our emotions, and make the bright times sweeter. We labored mostly alone, support coming from other sources, but regrets have no meaning here. Deep down, we are the same people we were during our formative years.

As corny as it sounds, the memories I carry from high school make up a huge part of who I am as a person. I hold on to the silliness, the openness, the happiness and general lack of angst and anger from that time. Who I was with those friends is who I was as a person, and who I still am. I am myself with them, I am happy. So getting together again after 13 years was as comfortable as putting on an old pair of favorite shoes.

When the five of us decided to go on a backpacking trip, I was elated. The memories of past adventures flooded in and the excitement grew through the month. I dug out my camping gear, started preparing weeks in advance. I built my own stove, with memories of the exploring the Badlands of central Oregon, the windy night in the Steins Mountains when our tents blew down, and hiking Dry River canyon in the dark. Our impromptu adventures of the past were a lesson in shared misery at times, overcome by the energy and optimism of youth. This time around something was a little different. We were wiser; we planned our route and food adequately. We had enough tents and tarps for everyone to be comfortable. We didn't eat hot dogs from the fire on coat hangers so hot they would burn your lips. Having families of our own meant that we had an obligation to reign in the stupidity of youth, and be safe. 

But that makes has little impact on the fun.

We talked late into the night, the warmth of fire and friendship fueling the conversation. We reminisced about the past, the fun times, the trivial moments not lost to memory. We shared our present lives, and future plans, the successes and failures of the past. We delved deep into topics that as callow youths we dared not tread. The bond we knew as children was strengthened through sharing that night. We were changed for the better, taking solace in shared threads, knowing we were not alone. Where we once were disparate, we were now whole.

The light shines on a new day now. The past a bright moment shining on memory, reflected into future. The forthcoming night is no longer a dark unimaginable fear, for we have the strength of unity, the link of friendship, affection and unity. Life is now as it should be, and I am thankful, grateful, and fundamentally happy for these friends.
